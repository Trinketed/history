# TrinketedHistory

Arena match history and VOD timestamp addon for World of Warcraft. Part of the [Trinketed](https://github.com/Trinketed/addon) addon suite.

## Features

### Match History

- Tracks teams, specs, races, ratings, rating changes, MMR, duration
- Filterable by comp, partner, enemy comp, enemy player, enemy race, result
- Export/import match data (compressed, shareable)

### Session Breakdown
- Groups matches into play sessions based on time gaps (60 min) and partner changes
- Session list shows partners, bracket, W-L, win%, rating range, net rating change
- Drill-down expands sessions to show individual matches
- Filter by bracket, time range, or partner

### VOD Timestamps
